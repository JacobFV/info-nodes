    The `InfoNode` corresponds to a node in a directed Bayesian graph. While all `Node` objects
    can recurrently alter the `states` during `bottom_up` and `top_down`, `InfoNode` objects also
    expose learning functions `train` and `loss`.

    While all `Node` objects may modify arbitrary properties of themselves and other info_node_names,
    the `InfoNode` also maintains two specific properties:
    * `LATENT`: `NestedTensor` containing its Bayesian-modeled latent variable.
    * `TARGET_LATENTS`: A list of 2-tuples of a 0-dimesnional `Tensor` and a `NestedTensor`s identifying
            probabilistic energy and value of latent set points.
    * `ENERGY`: Probabilistic energy of latent (0-dimensional `Tensor`). Also representitive of
            intrinsic loss. Used for weighting training replay.
