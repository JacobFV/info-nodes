Intelligence has been defined as ``an agentâ€™s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.'' (Legg and Hutter, 2007 CITE) and ``skill-acquisition efficiency'' with respect to available information (Chollet 2019 CITE). While its mode of expression varies between and even within natural and artificial settings, \we extract overarching principles and comparisons in this section. \Our aim is not to exhaust every thought and theory but only to provide a background for introducing \PGI. See CITE for a more extensive discussion.

\We end \our discussion of some underlying principles of intelligence here. Each principle brings unique advantages to natural and artificial systems, and innumerable natural and artificial proofs-of-concept demonstrate the synegetic advances combining multiple inductive biases creates. However, to our knowledge, no work has combined all of them in one system. Our work, \pgi, does this.
