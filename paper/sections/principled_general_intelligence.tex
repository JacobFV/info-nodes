Make brief statement on why prediction is a general principle of intelligence

Define PGI 

The observation that every individual neuron individually minimizes energetic difference while also joining a larger neuronal network leads us to develop a network of world models. This is an extension to parallel combinations such as neural ensembles and mixtures of experts \cite{Shazeer2017} like Switch Transformers as well as serial combinations like content filtration networks and hierarchiel prediction and reinforcement learning.
